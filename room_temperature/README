The data plotted here was collected in my bedroom using a "weather
forecast multi-channel in-out thermometer with cable free sensor and
radio controlled clock" (model TTN302). The data is from the winter of
2011 in Christchurch, NZ. We had recently purchased a house after
several years living in Europe and were more than a little shocked by
how cold our room temperature was, despite having a
heat-pump. Consequently we added insulation to the ceiling (Terra
Lana), underfloor (Autex) and a moisture vapour barrier was laid on
the ground under the house. A week later the single-glazed windows in
the house were removed and replaced with double-glazed windows by
Thermoglaz (www.thermoglaz.co.nz). Their method allowed us to retain
the character of the original wooden frames.

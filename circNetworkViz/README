circNetworkViz: a circular visualization tool for bipartate networks.  

given some layered (partate) network data - draw a network diagram,
illustrating the layers as a series of concentric circles.

In order to run on the example data:
R CMD BATCH --no-save  network.R

#File Formats (tab-delimited):
file 1 (networkLayers.tsv):      node->layer-mapping              [the ordering in this file determines the node order on the circles]
file 2 (networkConnections.tsv): node->node-connections (weights) []


TODO:
-add optimisation methods for minimising the total edge lengths by transpositions of nodes and rotation of the layers.
-add support for more than 2 layers
-make into a proper R package
-add visualisation for edge weights
